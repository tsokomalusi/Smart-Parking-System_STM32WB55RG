# Microcontrollers & IOT: Learn with Real Online Hardware
I recently participated in a hands-on Microcontrollers and IOT course on Udemy, instructed by Luiz Rodriguez.
Completed practical exercises and assignments using a real STM32WBR55G hardware accessed remotely via the 
Labsland platform -enabling development and testing without the need for a physical board

## Tools used
